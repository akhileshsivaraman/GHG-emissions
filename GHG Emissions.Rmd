## How are UK emissions changing?
### Overall

* GHG emissions are trending downwards with a 40.4% reduction in the mass of air emission per annum in thousand tonnes of C02 equivalent
* GHG emissions in 2021 are 340'158 thousand tonnes of CO2e lower than in 1990

Industries contributing the most to emissions:

* Eight have contributed heavily to total emissions over the 31-year period
* All 8 were amongst the top 8 highest emitters in 2021
* In 1990, Public Administration was in the top 8 and has since been displaced by Wholesale and Retail

```


Industries reducing emissions the quickest and the slowest:

* Although emissions have fallen overall, there has not been a reduction in emissions across the board. Construction, Real Estate, Wholesale & Retail Trade, Administrative Activities and Accommodation & Food Services have seen increases
* Comparatively, amongst the top 8 emitters, Agriculture, Forestry & Fishing, Consumer Expenditure and Transport & Storage have seen smaller emissions reductions (<15%)
* The biggest percentage decrease in emissions has come from Mining & Quarrying with the biggest percentage increase coming from Real Estate
* While Real Estate has seen the biggest percentage increase, Construction has seen the biggest absolute increase
* The largest absolute decrease in emissions has been in Electricity Supply
```{r}
# percentage changes
ghg_section_pct_changes <- ghg_section_totals |>
  rowwise(`Section name`) |>
  summarise(pct_change = ((`2021` - `1990`)/`1990`)*100) |>
  arrange(desc(pct_change))

# absolute changes
ghg_section_absolute_changes <- ghg_section_totals |>
  rowwise(`Section name`) |>
  summarise(absolute_change = `2021` - `1990`) |>
  arrange(desc(absolute_change))
```



### Sectors
Sectors contributing the most to emissions:

* Since 1991, 7 sectors have produced more than 1 million thousand tonnes of CO2e
* These 7 sectors were also the top emitters in 2021
* 5 feature in the top 7 emitters of 1990 with Manufacture of petrochemicals and Mining of coal and lignite rounding out the list in place of Electricity production - gas and Air transport services
```{r}
# total emissions over period
ghg_sector_total_period <- ghg_sector_totals |>
  rowwise(Sector) |>
  summarise(total_emissions = sum(c_across("1990":"2021"))) |>
  arrange(desc(total_emissions))

# top 7 emitters in 2021
top_emitting_sectors_2021 <- ghg_sector_totals |>
  slice_max(order_by = `2021`, n = 7)

# top 7 emitters in 1990
top_emitting_sectors_1990 <- ghg_sector_totals |>
  slice_max(order_by = `1990`, n = 7)

setdiff(top_emitting_sectors_2021$Sector, top_emitting_sectors_1990$Sector)
setdiff(top_emitting_sectors_1990$Sector, top_emitting_sectors_2021$Sector)
```


Industries reducing emissions the quickest and the slowest:

* Of the 131 sectors, 100 have reduced emissions over the 31-year period
* Electricity production has experienced the largest increases and reductions in emissions
* Production using oil has seen the greatest decrease while production from other sources has seen the greatest increases in emissions (by both percentage and absolute number)
```{r}
# percentage changes
ghg_sector_pct_changes <- ghg_sector_totals |>
  rowwise(`Sector`) |>
  summarise(pct_change = ((`2021` - `1990`)/`1990`)*100) |>
  arrange(desc(pct_change))

# absolute changes

## How might emissions change over the next 5 years?

### Forecasting total emissions

```{r}
# create time series object
ts_annual_emissions <- ts(annual_emissions$Emissions, frequency = 1, start = 1990, end = 2021)

# autocorrelation and partial acf
autocor_annual_emissions <- acf(ts_annual_emissions) # significant autocorrelation for x + 7
p_autocor_annual_emissions <- pacf(ts_annual_emissions) # indicates that there is non-significant noise influencing autocorrelation

# ARIMA
model_annual_emissions <- auto.arima(y = ts_annual_emissions)
model_annual_emissions

# check if this is a good model
acf(model_annual_emissions$residuals)
pacf(model_annual_emissions$residuals) # both indicate stationarity

# forecast
forecast_annual_emissions <- forecast(model_annual_emissions, h = 5, level = 30)

plot(forecast_annual_emissions,
     showgap = F)

autoplot(forecast_annual_emissions,
         fcol = "red") +
  autolayer(forecast_annual_emissions, showgap = F)
```

### Forecasting industry emissions

```{r}
industries <- ghg_section_totals$`Section name`

forecast_industry_emissions <- map(industries, industry_forecast, ghg_section_totals)

forecast_industry_emissions_plots <- map(forecast_industry_emissions, autoplot)
```
